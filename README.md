# remotedebug-core-spec
Specification for the RemoteDebug Core Protocol Specification.

## The proposal

This is a proposal to introduce a **core protocol specification** based on common and public API's that today are shared between Webkit and Chromium. These API's already are used and deployed on a broad variety of devices today, and should give new implementors (ex: Microsoft, Mozilla, Facebook) a stable set of API's as an implemetation target to reach parity, while giving existing implementors (Google, Apple) a head-start without pushing additional commitments on their shoulders, as the API's already committed to through their public and non-experimental nature.

## Work processes

We should adapt a simiar approach to how the [Service Worker specification](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker) came to life, by using GitHub to manage issues, commits and revisions of the specification.

## Documentation

The current `protocol.json` file can be fetched and viewed in tools like A, B, C and D.
